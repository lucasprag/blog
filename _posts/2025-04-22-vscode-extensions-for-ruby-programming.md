## [Fuzzy Ruby Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Blinknlights.fuzzy-ruby-server)

Fuzzy Ruby Server provides **go-to-definition** and **find references** features. It works flawlessly on my personal projects and very well at work as well. Sometimes it doesn't know which class definition to go to, but it shows a list with a preview that you can select. At work, we have over-complicated namespaces and repeated class names, so it makes sense it can't figure it out by itself.

I heard good things about and would recommend [Ruby LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopify.ruby-lsp), but I always have trouble making it work. At work, I use Docker, which is not supported unless you want to also run VSCode inside Docker. However, even on my own computer, I often see errors and can't easily figure them out.

Fuzzy Ruby Server just works‚Ñ¢Ô∏è with very good accuracy.

## [change-case](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.change-case)

Change-case provides many commands to change the case of the selected text between snake, camel, pascal, constant, kebab, and many others.

This extension is especially useful when working with Rails and React; however, I find myself using it frequently within Ruby code as well.

## [Ruby Around the Block](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=elliotlarson.ruby-around-the-block)

This extension provides a Ruby Block Toggle command to toggle between `{ }` and `do end` syntaxes for Ruby blocks.

## [vscode-run-rspec-file](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Thadeu.vscode-run-rspec-file)

![run rspec]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/vscode-ext-run-rspec.png)

## [rails-rspec-file-toggler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=malt-03.rails-rspec-file-toggler&ssr=false)

This extension provides a command to toggle between spec and implementation, and it works really well.

## [endwise](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kaiwood.endwise)

This extension adds the `end` in Ruby methods, classes, blocks, etc. Very small, yet coding without it is a hassle.

## [Standard Ruby](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=testdouble.vscode-standard-ruby) or [RuboCop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rubocop.vscode-rubocop)

Depending on what linter/formatter you use, they provide format-on-save, which is very helpful. I don't care about spacing or which type of comma to use. I just code, save, and then I see my code all fall in line.

## [erb](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CraigMaslowski.erb)

Provides syntax highlighting for ERB templates.

## [jbuilder highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MashDuek.jbuilder-highlight)

Provides syntax highlighting for jbuilder templates.

# Bonus: Non-Ruby related, yet very useful extensions

## [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

Auto-complete when writing Tailwind classes, even when using `@apply`.

## [Thunder Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client)

Feature-rich alternative to [Postman](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Postman.postman-for-vscode).

## [Project Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager)

Save a folder or workspace as a Project in the extension and access them easily from a list.

## [Open In GitHub](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sysoev.vscode-open-in-github)

Provides a command to quickly copy the GitHub link of the currently open file. Very helpful when you want to share the file or point to a line of code to send to someone on your team.

You can select a section in code, run the command, and send it. When the person opens it, it will be highlighted.

## [Git Mob co-author commits](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RichardKotze.git-mob)

Provides a list of co-authors to include in your commits. This is especially useful when pair programming.

## [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)

Gives you warnings of misspelled words in VSCode in whatever you are writing. Specially useful for blog posts!

## [TeamDocs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lucasprag.teamdocs)

Provides a way to check your team's markdown documentation without having to leave your code.

At work, we have a repository with all our documentation, such as ADRs, decision docs, setup docs, and guides. With this extension, I can preview all the docs by using the Activity Bar or by using the `TeamDocs: search` command.

### In the Activity Bar
