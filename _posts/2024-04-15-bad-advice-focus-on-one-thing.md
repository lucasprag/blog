This is one of the most common advice I get when I talk about my projects to other people, especially with people that don't build projects of their own:

> You keep shipping project after project. You need to stop and focus on one thing only.

That's actually the opposite of what I should be doing.

It's counter intuitive to keep shipping projects when you don't get great results from each time you ship something, but here is a little story.

## The 101st picture.

There is a story in the internet that I've heard many times.

> An art teacher told 10 students to take 101 pictures and another 10 students to take only one great picture but put it all on it.

> The 101st picture from the students that took 101 pictures were much better than the pictures from the students that only took one great picture.

That's because you learn more when you get more done.

## Do you put all your money into only one investment?

No. Why would you invest your time making only one thing?

By diversifying your apps, you protect yourself if one goes badly and you have more changes of shipping an app that goes really well.

Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

## Easier on the mind

It's easy to get blocked after shipping many updates to one app. When you have more than one app in the works, you can rest from one problem and get back to it later with a renewed mind.

## Even the Bible says to invest in many ventures

As a christian, it's only natural to try find guidance for everything in the bible, including entrepreneurship.

Blessed are you because there is an abundance of wisdom in the bible, especially in the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.

> [2] Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight; you do not know what disaster may come upon the land. -- Ecclesiastes 11:2 NIV

> [6] Sow your seed in the morning, and at evening let your hands not be idle, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both will do equally well. -- Ecclesiastes 11:6 NIV

And there is much more!

## Conclusion

Ship more! And learn while doing it.
