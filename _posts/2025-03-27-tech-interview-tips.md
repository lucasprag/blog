I have participated in several hiring processes at my current company and others before that as well. I mostly focused on hiring senior software engineers. Usually, I would participate in the technical interview and evaluate the take-home assignment containing a test project.

Here are some tips to help you answer some of the most common questions in technical interviews.

## Question #1: Tell me about yourself.

This is a very common first question. Usually, it is the first step to get to know more about you.

This question can be asked in many different ways, such as "Could you give us an overview of your career?" or "Could you explain your past experiences?" What interviewers are really asking is, "Are you a fit for this job position?"

It's your job to answer that using your Elevator Pitch ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.

> ‚Ñπ Info<br>
> An elevator pitch quickly summarizes your experiences and skills in a short period of time, like the time it takes to go up in an elevator. It can either elevate the tone or level of the interview or diminish it.

A good elevator pitch will:

### 1. Connect your experiences and skills to the job position or company stack

If the job description is asking for a Ruby engineer and you have experience with Ruby, avoid talking too much about experiences with Java.

Even if you have more experience in Java than in Ruby, perhaps just briefly mention unrelated experience when you can highlight skills that are interchangeable.

### 2. Highlight impactful experiences

Avoid going through all your experiences. Bring to the front the ones where you had a great impact, such as leading the research, planning, and/or implementation of a large feature, refactor, or optimization.

Some folks make the mistake of going through all their experiences starting from their first few jobs.

Others only talk about their current job, even if they didn't have many opportunities to do impactful work.

Talk about the most impactful and relevant experiences, connecting them to the job position. They are usually the most recent ones.

## Question #2: Could you talk about a project you are proud of?

What this question is really asking is, "What is a cool project that can show off your skills?"

Some folks focus too much on being proud of the project, which isn't the point.

The point is to talk about a project while showing off your:
- hard skills -- such as programming, debugging, finding bottlenecks, writing tests, system design, an eye for code quality, etc.
- soft skills -- such as communication, leadership, time management, willingness to learn, etc.

## Question #3: Have you ever worked on improving the performance of a system?

What is behind that question is, "Do you **know** how to optimize a system?".

Some folks focus too much on what exactly they have done to optimize a system or endpoint, but that isn't the point.

The point is -- yes, highlight your experiences if you have them -- but also show off that you know the techniques for accomplishing it.

For instance, when optimizing some part of a system that is visibly slow, you could start with these common steps:

1. Add instrumentation -- meaning metrics, logs, profiling, etc.
2. Find the bottlenecks -- based on the instrumentation.
3. Experiment with some solutions using the instrumentation to know if it was resolved or not.

As for solutions, it's good to mention even the ones you never had the opportunity to use.

For example, you could say that you have experience with:

1. Optimizing or simplifying database queries.
2. Eager loading or lazy loading data.
3. Improving hits on indexes.

But you are also aware of other techniques that didn't make sense at work yet, such as:

4. Adding cache.
5. Refactoring the code to break it down or simplify it.
6. Database or app sharding.
7. Horizontal or vertical scaling.

Be prepared to talk about the advantages or disadvantages of any of them because they all have trade-offs.

## Conclusion

Summarizing all the above:

- Practice your Elevator Pitch ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.
- Connect most of what you say to the job.
- Highlight the most relevant experiences first.
- Don't just talk about what you did, but also about what you know.

Good luck in your tech interview. üëãüèº
